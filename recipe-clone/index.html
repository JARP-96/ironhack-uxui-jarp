      <h1>Apple Pies</h1>
      <p>
        This was my grandmother's
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_pie">apple pie</a> recipe.
        I have never seen another one quite like it. It will always be my
        <b>favorite</b>
        and has won me several first place prizes in local competitions.
        <i>I hope it becomes one of your favorites as well!</i>
      </p>

      <h2>Directions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a
          saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and
          brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded
          slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and
          butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so that it does not run off.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350
          degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until
          apples are soft.
